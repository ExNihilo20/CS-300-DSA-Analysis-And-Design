  <p>This course required students to learn various data structures and algorithms, author source code in the C++ programming language to complete coding challenges,   and explain/defend the approach we took to solving our challenges.</p>

<h2>What was the problem you were solving in the final projects for this course?</h2>
  <p>Two projects are listed in this portfolio repository. Students receive requirements from a university to a CSV file of course numbers, course names and course prerequisites; and to sort/print out the course materials in such a way as can be used by university admission faculty.</p> 
  <p>The first project required students to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Apply non-coding development methodologies for outlining an algorithmic design</li>
    <li>Evaluate complex data structures that solve a given problem using advanced algorithmic designs</li>
    <li>Write pseudocode to address advising's requirements</li>
    <li>Implement the most efficient Data Structure for the task [vector/hashtable/tree]</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To accomplish this task, students need to use pseudocode to define how a program opens a file, reads the file's data, parses each line, and perfoms error-handline. Students should show how to create course objects, and print out course information and prerequisites. Students shall create a menu that prompts program users to load the chosen data structure, print the alphanumerically ordered course list, print a course by title [to include any prerequisites], or exit; providing numerical choices mapped to program actions.</p>
  <p>Finally, students will need to perform a Big O analysis of the program to evaluate the run-time and memory of the data structure(s) that are used to address the program's requirements. Students will explain the pros and cons of each data structure analyzed. Finally, students will defend their recommended data structure used to complete the assignment.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The second project required students to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Develop a functional C++ program to meet the pseudocode design requirements of Project One</li>
    <li>Create a user menu to prompt users for input</li>
    <li>Load the chosen data structure</li>
    <li>Print the alphanumerically sorted course list for the Computer Science Department</li>
    <li>Print the course title and prerequisites</li>
    <li>Exit the program</li>
  </ol>
