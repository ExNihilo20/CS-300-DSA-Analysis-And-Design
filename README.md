  <p>This course required students to learn various data structures and algorithms, author source code in the C++ programming language to complete coding challenges,   and explain/defend the approach we took to solving our challenges.</p>

<h2>What was the problem students were required to solve in the final projects for this course?</h2>
  <p>Two projects are listed in this portfolio repository. Students receive requirements from a university to a CSV file of course numbers, course names and course prerequisites; and to sort/print out the course materials in such a way as can be used by university admission faculty.</p> 
  <p>The first project required students to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Apply non-coding development methodologies for outlining an algorithmic design</li>
    <li>Evaluate complex data structures that solve a given problem using advanced algorithmic designs</li>
    <li>Write pseudocode to address advising's requirements</li>
    <li>Implement the most efficient Data Structure for the task [vector/hashtable/tree]</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To accomplish this task, students need to use pseudocode to define how a program opens a file, reads the file's data, parses each line, and perfoms error-handline. Students should show how to create course objects, and print out course information and prerequisites. Students shall create a menu that prompts program users to load the chosen data structure, print the alphanumerically ordered course list, print a course by title [to include any prerequisites], or exit; providing numerical choices mapped to program actions.</p>
  <p>Finally, students will need to perform a Big O analysis of the program to evaluate the run-time and memory of the data structure(s) that are used to address the program's requirements. Students will explain the pros and cons of each data structure analyzed. Finally, students will defend their recommended data structure used to complete the assignment.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The second project required students to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Develop a functional C++ program to meet the pseudocode design requirements of Project One</li>
    <li>Create a user menu to prompt users for input</li>
    <li>Load the chosen data structure</li>
    <li>Print the alphanumerically sorted course list for the Computer Science Department</li>
    <li>Print the course title and prerequisites</li>
    <li>Exit the program</li>
  </ol>
  
<h2>How did students approach the problem?</h2>
<p>The course requirements were approached sequentially. The course work had readings, discussions to collaborate and compare ideas among students, and core assignments to test what we learned. I personally approached the course requirements in iterations, completing portions of the work spread over multiple weeks. Code that is written extensibly is able to be modified piece by piece, which facilitates a better workflow than trying to jam an entire project through at once. Previous courses have taught students Scrum methods for completing requirements, and I was able to spread my work out over sprint iterations that had defined goals and and established definition of DONE.</p>

<h2>How did students overcome any roadblocks they encountered while going through the activities or project?</h2>
<p>From a personal experience, I reached out to faculty quickly if there was a problem or something that was not clear in the course. These are accelerated courses, so there is not much time to fix any mistakes for submissions - if given the opportunity to do so. The projects and the weekly materials had to be completed and submitted as soon as possible, in order to keep up with the pace of the course load. As in the real world, the pace of work is rapid and deadlines have to be met.</p>

<h2>How has the work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?</h2>
<p>This course required me to use the C++ language to build a program that created an ideal data structure, fed information through the data structure, and output meaningful information to meet the course and instructor's requirements. Through the past 8 weeks, I have been introduced to data structure and algorithm construction techniques. I now get to carry that forward and work to refine my approach to using these techniques in the workplace.</p>

<h2>How has the work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</h2>
<p>The course required a number of students to make modifications to their core code and to resubmit work, if necessary. The course required students to write pseudocode to plan the source code for their applications. Students learned how to plan the work before doing it. This saves a lot of trouble once projects are under construction, because some problems can be seen during the planning phase that may otherwise negatively impact the project during the development phase.</p>
